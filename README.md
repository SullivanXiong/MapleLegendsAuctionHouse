# MapleLegendsAuctionHouse
MapleLegends is a private server that brings back the old-school MapleStory experience, offering a nostalgic version of the game that replicates the classic feel from its early days. The early versions of MapleStory lacked an auction house with which would allow users to effectively search for items, so this implementation solves that problem.
